    <title>SAARANG Speaker Outreach Dashboard</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Amber -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA to manage speaker outreach for the SAARANG event. The core is a responsive grid of speaker "cards," turning the static email list into an actionable tool. Users can filter speakers by industry and invitation status. Key interactions include updating a speaker's status via a dropdown on their card, which dynamically updates summary counters and a visual chart. Clicking a button on the card opens a modal with the pre-written, customized email, complete with a copy-to-clipboard function. This structure was chosen for usability, providing a clear overview, at-a- glance status tracking, and efficient workflow management for the event organizers. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: List of 50 potential speakers (updated) and their customized email drafts.
        - Goal: Manage outreach process.
        - Viz/Presentation Method: An interactive dashboard with filterable cards, summary statistics, and a status visualization chart.
        - Interaction:
            - Speaker List -> Interactive Cards (HTML/Tailwind): Provides a visually appealing, scannable overview of each candidate. Includes mobile number.
            - Invitation Status -> Dropdown & Color-coding (JS): Allows for easy, at-a-glance status tracking and updates.
            - Email Text -> Modal Popup with "Copy" button (JS): Keeps the main UI clean and makes the core content (the email) easily accessible and usable.
            - Status Summary -> Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas): Offers a quick, high-level visual summary of the outreach campaign's progress.
            - ✨ AI-Powered Email Refinement (Gemini API Integration): A new feature allowing users to send the email draft to an LLM for refinement, displayed within the modal, enhancing the drafting workflow.
        - Justification: This interactive dashboard model is far more useful than a static document, transforming the list of emails into a functional project management tool for the event organizers. The AI refinement directly supports the core task of sending effective invitations.
        - Library/Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash for text generation).
