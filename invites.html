    <title>Saarang sponsor Outreach Dashboard</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Amber -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA to manage sponsor outreach for the Saarang event. The core is a responsive grid of sponsor "cards," turning the static email list into an actionable tool. Users can filter sponsors by invitation status. Key interactions include updating a sponsor's status via a dropdown on their card, which dynamically updates summary counters and a visual chart. Clicking a button on the card opens a modal with the pre-written, customized email, complete with a copy-to-clipboard function. This structure was chosen for usability, providing a clear overview, at-a-glance status tracking, and efficient workflow management for the event organizers. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: List of 50 potential sponsors (updated from image) and their customized email drafts for Saarang.
        - Goal: Manage outreach process for Saarang.
        - Viz/Presentation Method: An interactive dashboard with filterable cards, summary statistics, and a status visualization chart.
        - Interaction:
            - sponsor List -> Interactive Cards (HTML/Tailwind): Provides a visually appealing, scannable overview of each candidate, including mobile number.
            - Invitation Status -> Dropdown & Color-coding (JS): Allows for easy, at-a-glance status tracking and updates.
            - Email Text -> Modal Popup with "Copy" button (JS): Keeps the main UI clean and makes the core content (the email) easily accessible and usable. Email content updated for Saarang theme.
            - Status Summary -> Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas): Offers a quick, high-level visual summary of the outreach campaign's progress.
            - ✨ AI-Powered Email Refinement (Gemini API Integration): Allows refining email drafts, now tailored for Saarang's context.
            - Sample Event Card: Demonstrates dynamic text loading into the modal from an arbitrary div.
        - Justification: This interactive dashboard model is a functional project management tool for Saarang outreach, with AI support for crafting effective invitations.
        - Library/Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash for text generation).
